1. `npm install`
2. `npm build`

### In my-app

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`

### Sass

`my-component/src/components/my-cat/cat.scss` imports another scss file from a shared location, but the imported scss file is not included in the `my-component/dist` bundle.

### TypeScript Paths

`my-component/tsconfig.json` uses the compilerOptions.paths to allow 'project' paths rather than relative paths.

Thus, `my-component/src/components/my-cat/cat.tsx` can refer to `my-component/src/model/random-cat.ts` as **model/random-cat** rather than **../../model/random-cat**

## Current workaround

I've made a postbuild script that does some import path re-writing via regex and copies over any scss files in `src/` but not `dist/collection`
